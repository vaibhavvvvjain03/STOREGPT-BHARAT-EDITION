## 🎓 Judge Questions You Might Get

### Q: "How does it work without a backend?"

### Q: "How do you plan to monetize this?"
**A**: "Three options:
1. Subscription: ₹99-299/month for small shops
2. Commission: 2-5% on transactions
3. Premium features: Advanced analytics, AI tools, bulk operations"

### Q: "What about data security?"
**A**: "All user data will be encrypted and stored in Supabase with industry-standard security. We follow GDPR compliance."

### Q: "How will you get users?"
**A**: "Distribution channels:
1. Partner with wholesale markets
2. Local business associations
3. WhatsApp and community groups
4. YouTube tutorials in Indian languages"

### Q: "What's the USP vs Amazon/Flipkart?"
**A**: "We're not competing. We're empowering small retailers to go digital locally. Amazon/Flipkart are marketplaces; we're a store builder. We focus on Indian languages, local payments, and offline-first."
